# Hello World
Writing a post about me redoing this blog. Initially I created it using a theme and added just basic info into it. After some time though I wanted to do more with it, learn more about the framework and see what I can do with it.

My goals so far with it are the following:

1. Redo site so I can have a bit more flexibility in styling, even though styling isn't a strength, something I can learn more about.
1. Use this as a project to learn more about different tools and languages

### Design choices made
- Opted to use pico css to get started with styling
- To not have to install as much, and learn more about docker, I opted to create a `Dockerfile` and compose file to develop the site locally.
   - This may change in future, but in the spirit of learning more I thought it would be fun
